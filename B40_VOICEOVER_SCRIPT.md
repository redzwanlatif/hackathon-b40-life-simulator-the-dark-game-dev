# 🔥 DELIVERY TIPS

### For AI Voice:
- Add periods for pauses
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis (AI reads louder)
- Numbers written out (sixty percent, not 60%)

### For Human Voice:
- Stand up while recording (more energy)
- Smile while talking (sounds friendlier)
- Record in quiet room, close to mic
- Do 2-3 takes, pick best parts
- Energy should be 20% more than feels natural
